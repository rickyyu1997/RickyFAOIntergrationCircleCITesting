# NetSuite Integration - Cancellation injection implementation

## Description
- Once triggered this lambda reads a SQS queue that contains the events sent by NewStore for the cancellation, event type `order.cancelled` and `order.items_cancelled`.
- For each event it fetches the SalesOrder information from NetSuite and closes the cancelled items in the SalesOrder.
- There are 2 cases considered:
    - Full Cancellation (original event order.cancelled): 
        - Get the Netsuite Sales Order
        - Go through the items, set them all to closed: True
        - Update the Sales order
    - Item Cancellation (original event order.items_cancelled):
        - Get the Netsuite Sales Order
        - Go through the items, set the items which are cancelled in Newstore to closed
        - If there is a discount related for the item, there is a discount item in Netsuite (as next line) â†’ this needs to be closed as well

## Order Event to NetSuite Integration

This integration takes events created from the NewStore [event stream](https://apidoc.newstore.io/newstore-cloud/hooks_eventstream.html#event-stream-webhooks-publish-event) webook.

All events from the event stream are received in a very similar manner, which is why they are all included in a single integration that receives the events and push them to the right SQS queue. The `netsuite_event_stream_receiver` acts as an orchestrator and single point of entry for all events; When an event arrives that integration determines which category of event it belongs to then places it into its respective queue for later processing. Each event type has a respective queue and specialized processor/integration. The processor's/integration's jobs are to take the event from the SQS queue and transform it into the format as expected by NetSuite which also means requesting NetSuite to handle certain actions (e.g. issuing a credit note) as a part of the process.


```
{ NewStore Event Stream } ==> `netsuite_event_stream_receiver`
     |
     V
[AWS SQS] <== Events are placed into categorized queues
     |
     V
[Process Event and Transform to NetSuite format] <== Retrieve event from SQS and process (This integration)
     |
     V
{ Update NetSuite }
```

##### Fields
The fields can all be referenced using their generic name in the `scriptId` parameters, keeping them consistent across tenants and environments so long as the generic naming conventions are followed.
##### Objects
NetSuite objects need to be referenced explicitly (e.g. payment processing types, store locations); for these mappings it requires a tightly coupled reference to the NetSuite Internal ID be mapped to the value in NewStore. The Internal ID is a basic auto-incrementing primary key used for pretty much everything in NetSuite, by nature its value is entirely dependent on the order in which objects are added to NetSuite; meaning the values will differ between tenants and environments. In the case of referencing NetSuite objects, a mapping has to be manually maintained between NewStore values and their corresponding NetSuite objects' Internal IDs.


## Build and Deploy

- It's done when the codes are committed, by circle-ci


## Testing
